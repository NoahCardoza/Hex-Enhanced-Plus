# HexEnhanced+
HexEnhanced+ was a userscript originally created for [Hacker Experience 1](https://legacy.hackerexperience.com/). It was developed by [MacHacker](https://https://github.com/NoahCardoza), Johannes (GeneralFranklin) and Jasperr.

Now it will be embeded straight into RE-Revived (name pending), a copy of the original Hacker Experience.
